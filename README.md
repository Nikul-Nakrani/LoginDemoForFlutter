## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Nikul-Nakrani/LoginDemoForFlutter.git


## How It Works

This app utilizes Flutter's shared preferences plugin to store user credentials locally on the device. When the user attempts to log in, their credentials are compared with the stored credentials. If they match, the user is logged in; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
